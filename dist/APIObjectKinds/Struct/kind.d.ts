 * A collection of a finite number of `Attribute`s that describes a category
 * of `Entry`. In a relational database, this is a table. In a
 * document-oriented database, this may be a "document" or "subdocument."
 * In JSON, this is referred to as an "object." It does not describe an
 * instance of something, but a category of an instance.
